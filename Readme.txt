Program Description:
			Its a best utility software to read/change the version informations of different executable, dll, ocx and other binary files. User friendly interface and need no extra information or help notes to learn it.
You can also drag files from explorer and drop them to the text box instead of browsing them.
Super fast speed.

Technical Informations:
Last time I use a rich text box to read file which really takes too much time but this time I change all my programs to use variables.
Thats why my program run at super fast speed.
